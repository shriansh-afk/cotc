MCD.US consists of two parts: {SYMBOL_NAME}.{EXCHANGE_ID}, then you can use, for example, MCD.MX for Mexican Stock Exchange. or MCD.US for NYSE.




api_token – your own API KEY, which you will get after you subscribe to our services.




fmt – the output format. Possible values are ‘csv’ for CSV output and ‘json’ for JSON output. Default value: ‘csv’.




period – use ‘d’ for daily, ‘w’ for weekly, ‘m’ for monthly prices. By default, daily prices will be shown. Data aggregated weekly and monthly also shows weekly and monthly volume.




order – use ‘a’ for ascending dates (from old to new), ‘d’ for descending dates (from new to old). By default, dates are shown in ascending order.




from and to – the format is ‘YYYY-MM-DD’. If you need data from Jan 5, 2017, to Feb 10, 2017, you should use from=2017-01-05 and to=2017-02-10.

As a result, you will get the following data in CSV format:










Please note, that OHLC we provide in raw adjusted neither to splits nor to dividends, while adjusted closes are adjusted to both splits and dividends, and volume is adjusted to splits. If you need OHLC adjusted only to splits then it’s better to use our Technical API with the ‘function=splitadjusted’ parameter.










Sign up & Get Data




Daily Updates API




For daily updates on your end-of-day data, we recommend a special Bulk API for EOD, Splits and Dividends. With this API you will be able to download the data for a particular day for the entire exchange in seconds. Even to download the entire US exchange with more than 45,000 active tickers, you will need 1 API request and 5-10 seconds.




Stock Prices Data API with Dates Support




We support two formats for historical data dates.




EOD Historical Data




Here you can use ‘from’ and ‘to’ parameters with the format ‘YYYY-MM-DD’. For example, if you need to get data only from Jan 5, 2017, to Feb 10, 2017, you need to use from=2017-01-05 and to=2017-02-10. Then the final URL will be:

Yahoo Finance API Support




To support clients who used Yahoo Finance service non-official API which doesn’t work now (URL: ichart.finance.yahoo.com), we also support yahoo-style for dates. Here there will be 6 parameters.





First of all, for yahoo-style you need to use another endpoint:




https://eodhd.com/api/table.csv.




For symbol you should use s, then for MCD it will be: s=MCD.US.




For ‘from date’ you should use a, b, c for month, day, year. Then 2017-01-05 will be: a=00, b=05, c=2017.




For ‘to date’ you should use d, e, f for month, day, year. Then 2017-02-10 will be: d=01, e=10, f=2017.




Please note, that in Yahoo! Finance API first month is 0 and last month (December) is 11. Then you need to substract 1 from months.




For ‘period’ you should use g. Possible values are d for daily, w for weekly and m for montly.





BE CAREFUL, date used here in American notation: MONTH, DAY, YEAR.




And the final URL will be:
